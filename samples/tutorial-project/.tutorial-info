# Tutorial Project Metadata

This folder contains educational sample files with FAKE credentials
for learning how to use ShieldPrompt.

All values are intentionally obvious fakes:
- Database names: "ProductionDB" (generic placeholder)
- IP addresses: 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x (private ranges, non-routable)
- API keys: Clearly marked with "Tutorial", "Fake", "Example"
- SSNs: 123-45-6789 (Woolworth's test number, widely published)
- Credit cards: 4111-1111-1111-1111 (Visa test card)

Purpose: Safe learning environment for ShieldPrompt features.

DO NOT use these values in production code!
